### David Cicode
**Category:** OSINT - **Difficulty:** Easy  
**Description:**  
I love Google and all the services it provides and also those that rely on it.  
Morever, here is my Gmail account: *dav1d.c1cod3@gmail.com*  
> Flag format : dvCTF{part1_part2_part3}  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge, you need to use Ghunt and follow the steps below:  
- Ghunt email : *ghunt email dav1d.c1cod3@gmail.com*
- We can find his Maps account : https://www.google.com/maps/contrib/116570179360508069806/reviews
- There are 4 photos on his Maps account and the 1st one has a flag part (see the white price tag)
- Then we can also find his Calendar account : http://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/dav1d.c1cod3@gmail.com/public/basic.ics
- In this file, we can find one event with a flag part (VERY IMPORTANT - Restaurant on February 14th) and a link to a Google Groups (March Event on January 26th)
- Once we are on the Google Groups, we can check all the mails and find the last flag part (March Event ðŸ’»)

(Je pense que j'ajouterais des images sur Maps et quelques events sur Calendar pour que ce soit plus mÃ©langÃ©)
