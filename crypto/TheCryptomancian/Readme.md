### The CryptoMancian
**Category:** Crypto 
**Description:**  
Romain Carrière, a rather banal name... I wonder what his message is hiding

> Flag format : DVC******** 
> Example : DVCGOODLUCK

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge, you must first find the twitter account of Romain Carrière, it's easy to find and has lots of clues.  
The tweet "$$qD3b+=xv}J6)q_3Hll" is a trap and leads to a troll.
Paying attention to the user's profile picture, we notice that it is the Cryptonomicon book. By doing some research, we quickly find that the plot is based on the use of a known encryption method: The solitaire.  
After that, you must use the card sequence indicated on the twitter account in order to find the flag using the sloitaire decipher (on Dcode for example)
