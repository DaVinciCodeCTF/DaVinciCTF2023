# Lost World

Difficulty: easy

Challenge desc: 

```
A friend of mine lost his Minecraft world, he even left his dog there, he tried to find the deleted files but the only thing left were the screenshots he took at the beginning of his adventure.
Can you at least find the world's seed so he can start over in the same world?

Flag format is dvCTF{worldseed}
