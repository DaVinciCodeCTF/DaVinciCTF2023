**Category:** Physique - **Difficulty:** Medium  
**Description:**  
Now you have the wifi password, you need to find if there is a vulnerability on my webpage  
You need to connect on *DVCTF2023_Part2*.  
  
> Flag format : dvCTF{flag_text}  

**Solution:**  
To solve this challenge, you need to :  
1. Connect to the wifi *DVCTF2023_Part2* with the password *PAPAbiscoitos*   
2. Enter the main IP address of the router : *10.3.141.1*  
3. You arrive on a website (portfolio) with a login page with md5 password verification (http://10.3.141.1/login.php?source).  
4. To find the password, you need to scrape all pages with the [CeWL](https://www.kali.org/tools/cewl/) tool.  
5. You get a list of 230 words with this command : `cewl -w wordlist.txt http://10.3.141.1/`  
6. To get more password, you need to give your wordlist to hashcat : `hashcat --stdout -r /usr/share/hashcat/rules/clem9669_medium.rule wordlist.txt > dict.txt`  
You get a list of 39,4M passwords.
7. Now you can crack the password with hashcat : `hashcat -m 0 hash.txt dict.txt`
8. Once you have the password (*Freelance!89*), you can login to the website and get the flag.
